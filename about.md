Hi, I'm Christian!

## What I do

I'm a software developer from Illinois. I currently work on the website and recruiting software for [Locum Life LTD](https://www.locumlife.org), a locum tenens agency out of Burlington, IA. I spend most of my time working on .NET Core projects, but I also do full-stack work with VueJS, React, and Razor frontends.

I don't do any design work because I'm not the artsy creative type - I'm good with logic and systems, and I can implement existing designs well. When I have a project that needs to look halfway decent, I usually Frankenstein something together off of Pinterest, or just use a customized Bootstrap build. I have experience modifying Bootstrap using Sass overrides, which is what I did for the original versions of this blog and the Locum Life LTD website.

## Open source contributions

I have several ongoing projects of my own. However, I've recently started contributing to other open source software. I'll try to keep this list up-to-date, but I'll probably fall behind at some point.

## Other pursuits

When I'm not working on code, I like spending time learning foreign languages (badly, I might add). I also make the best omelet my wife has ever had, and I can make spicy Kung Pao chicken like nobody's business (seriously, go to your local Asian market and get dried chili peppers - it makes all the difference).

One of these days, I might pick my guitar back up. But for now, it makes a great place to keep all my dust.
