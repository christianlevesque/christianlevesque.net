## Planning our microservice

This app is going to be the smallest yet, in terms of original code. Since we're using Controllers, the routing work will be done for us and we can focus on writing our microservice (that's what frameworks are all about, right?)

### Middleware

We won't need any custom middleware for this app. We need to add CORS support and Controller support.

### Controllers

We only need one Controller: `FileAnalyseController` (because our path is `/fileanalyse`). `FileAnalyseController` needs to accept `POST` requests at `/fileanalyse` that upload a file from a form.

### Responses

The microservice tests don't specify an error response, so we'll just send a generic `400 Bad Request` if an error does occur - but it shouldn't as long as everything works, because the FreeCodeCamp tests aren't meant to create error conditions in your microservice this time.

As for the success response, we need a `FileMetadata` class with properties for the filename, MIME type, and size.

Now, we can start writing our File Metadata Microservice!

## Preparing our app

### Add Controller support

First thing, we need to configure our app to use Controllers. To do that, add `using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` to your `using` statements, then add a `ConfigureServices` method to the `Startup` class:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
}
```

This simply adds Controllers to the services.

Next, add routing and map your Controllers to endpoints in the `Configure()` method after `if (env.IsDevelopment())...`:

```csharp
app.UseRouting();
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllers();
});
```

This tells your app to use routing middleware and maps your Controller actions to endpoints in your app.

### Add CORS support

We know FreeCodeCamp can't test our API without CORS, so let's go ahead and configure that too. In `ConfigureServices`, add the following before `services.AddControllers()`:

```csharp
services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddDefaultPolicy(policy =>
    {
        policy.WithOrigins("https://www.freecodecamp.org")
              .WithMethods("POST")
              .AllowAnyHeader();
    });
});
```

This adds CORS to your app services and creates a default policy that allows `https://www.freecodecamp.org` to send `POST` requests to your app with any HTTP header.

Then, add `app.UseCors()` before `app.UseRouting`. Since we're using a default policy, we don't need to pass any arguments.

### Set up app URL

I forgot to do this in the initial commit of the app, so let's go ahead and add a `Urls` key to the `appsettings.json` file (other configuration omitted):

```json
{
	"Urls": "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
}
```

## Creating the `FileMetadata` model

Create a new directory within your app, `Models`, and create a file within called `FileMetadata.cs`. Open this file and add the following code:

```csharp
namespace file_metadata.Models
{
	public class FileMetadata
	{
		public string Name { get; set; }
		public string Type { get; set; }
		public long Size { get; set; }
	}
}
```

Our filename and MIME type will be `string`s, and our size should be a `long` - this isn't required by the app, but `IFormFile`'s file size property is a `long` so I decided just to go with that.

## Creating the `FileAnalyseController`

Let's start by creating the Controller file. Make a new directory within your app, `Controllers`, and add a file within named `FileAnalyseController.cs`. Open that file and enter the following code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace file_metadata.Controllers
{
	[ApiController]
	[Route("[controller]")]
	public class FileAnalyseController : ControllerBase
	{
		public IActionResult Index()
		{
			return Ok();
		}
	}
}
```

This code creates an API Controller routed to `/fileanalyse`. It has a single endpoint: `GET /fileanalyse`, which returns a blank `200 OK` response.

### Completing the Controller action

The `FileAnalyseController` is supposed to accept a `POST` request instead of `GET`, so add the `[HttpPost]` attribute to the `Index()` method.

The `Index()` method is supposed to receive a file upload named "upfile" from an upload form, so change the method signature to accept `[FromForm] IFormFile upfile` as an argument. `[FromForm]` tells ASP.NET Core that `upfile` is a field in a form body, and `IFormFile` tells ASP.NET Core that that field should be a file. To import `IFormFile`, add `using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http` to your `using` statements.

Finally, create an instance of `FileMetadata` and copy `IFormFile.FileName`, `IFormFile.Length`, and `IFormFile.ContentType` into the appropriate fields on `FileMetadata`. Wrap the entire call in a `try/catch` block to catch errors, and if any errors occur, return a generic `400 Bad Request`. Otherwise, return the data. Add `using System` to import the `Exception` class for the `try/catch`, and add `using file_metadata.Models` to import the `FileMetadata` model.

Your final `Index()` method should look like this:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Index([FromForm] IFormFile upfile)
{
    FileMetadata data;
    try
    {
        data = new FileMetadata
        {
            Name = upfile.FileName,
            Size = upfile.Length,
            Type = upfile.ContentType
        };
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        return BadRequest();
    }

    return Ok(data);
}
```

## Testing our application

Let's run! Launch the app and hop over to Postman. Since the app only does one thing, we only need to run a single manual test.

1. Create a `POST` request to `localhost:5000/fileanalyse`.
2. Set the `Origin` header to `https://www.freecodecamp.org`.
3. Set the `Access-Control-Request-Method` header to `POST`.
4. In the Body tab, set the body type to `form-data`
5. Add a single key named `upfile`. Hover your mouse near the right edge of the Key field and you'll see a small dropdown appear with the value `Text`. Switch this to `File`, then select any file you like from your hard drive in the Value field.

Send the request, and observe your file metadata! I used a picture of my wife and me in front of a windmill on our honeymoon (we're simple folks), so my file metadata response looked like this:

```json
{
    "name": "me-and-alicia-honeymoon.jpg",
    "type": "image/jpeg",
    "size": 1266824
}
```

## That's it!

That's one more down! Now you can create your own version of the microservice. At this point, you can probably go back and rewrite the other two microservices to use Controllers. You might even want to combile all your microservices into a single project - now that you can use Controllers and Middleware, you can get creative and set that up if you want.

A reference version of this final app can be found on [Github](https://github.com/christianlevesque/fcc-file-metadata-microservice), including deployment scripts for Bash and PowerShell.
