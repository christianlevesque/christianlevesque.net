<p>
	I'm good with the frontend, but I specialize in backend technologies. I've used most of the big names at one point or another, including PHP, Node.js/Express, C#/ASP.NET Core, and Java/Spring. There's not much here yet, but I'll be adding courses in the coming year - starting with ASP.NET Core, followed by ExpressJS.
