WordPress is one of the most popular solutions for small business websites, blogs, and hobby or special interest websites. It’s free to use, easy to set up, and cheap to host. But sometimes, you need to be able to host a WordPress site on the cheap without sacrificing performance.

In this free course, I will walk you through the steps needed to move your website from your current hosting provider to your very own VPS instance. Chances are, your WordPress site currently lives on a shared host – and that’s fine when you’re first starting out, but as soon as you start getting more than one or two visitors at a time, a shared host gets real slow, real fast. VPS hosting is comparable in price to a shared host, but it gives you far greater control over your hosting environment. Plus, since your website is the only one on your host, you’re not sharing resources with anyone else’s website, which helps keep your site responsive.

Buyer beware, though – VPS hosting isn’t for the faint of heart! It takes a few hours of work to get set up, and then once you do, you will still have to do some manual work from time to time. But if you want to serve your WordPress website at high speeds without paying for $100/month hosting, this is the course for you.
