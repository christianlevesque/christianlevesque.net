blurb: A complete introduction to programming in C#
---

C# is a great programming language to learn today. C# can be used to build desktop apps, websites, command line tools, and more, and if you want to get a job in programming, C# is one of the top languages for employment. (My first *and* second jobs in tech were both primarily C#-based - and when I was hired in my first role, the need was so great that I didn't even know C# before getting hired.)

In this course, I'll show you everything you need to get started developing all kinds of C# applications, from desktop apps to websites. We won't actually build any desktop apps or websites together, but by the end of this course, you will know everything you need to know about C# to get started. In the future, I'll be adding a course on web development in C#, so stay tuned!
