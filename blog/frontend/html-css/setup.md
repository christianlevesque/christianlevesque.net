Downloading the software

The first thing you need to do to get ready for the course is to download the software we will be using. As I said before, everything you absolutely need is on your computer already, but a developer is only as good as the tools she uses, so I recommend you start off using the right tools from the very beginning.

The first piece of software you need is Visual Studio Code, often called “VS Code” or “VSC.” [Click here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to visit the VS Code download site and click the blue download link for your operating system. Once the file is downloaded, run the installer and click through the pages until you come to the page entitled “Select Additional Tasks.” I recommend that you select all the checkboxes on this page before clicking “Next” (these checkboxes enable useful options that are difficult to enable after installation). Click through the rest of the installer, and when setup has completed, there will be a checkbox that says “Start Visual Studio Code now.” Make sure this is checked, then click “Finish.”

Once VS Code is open, it will start downloading some additional software that it uses. While VS Code does this, you can go ahead and grab Google Chrome if you don’t already have it. [Click here](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to visit the Chrome download site, then click the “Download Chrome” button and run the installer once it downloads.

## Setting up the course folder
   
I recommend that you store all the code you write in this course in one folder so you can always find it easily. You can name this folder anything you like (I named my folder `html-css-course`), and you can put it anywhere you like (I always put all of my code in a folder named “code” located in my user folder: `C:\Users\christian\code` on Windows and `/Users/christian/code` on Mac, but another good place for the folder might be on your Desktop).
   
Once you’ve set up your course folder, go ahead and switch to Visual Studio Code. Open your newly-created folder by selecting `File > Open Folder` and navigating to the course folder. Click on the folder and open it. Your window will now look something like this:

Now, we’re going to create a new folder for the Introduction section of this course. You can do that within Visual Studio Code by hovering the mouse over the html-css-course folder on the left and clicking the New Folder icon that appears.

When you click the New Folder icon, an input field appears to enter the name of the folder. Type “Introduction” and press Enter to create the new folder.

## That’s it!
   
Now you’re ready to move on to the next lesson of the course, Hello World!
