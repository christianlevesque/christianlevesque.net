blurb: An in-depth introduction to HTML and CSS for beginners
---

Welcome to my free course on HTML and CSS! If you’re new to web development, then you’re in the right place.

HTML (short for HyperText Markup Language) is a coding language used to display content on websites. CSS (short for Cascading Style Sheets) is a coding language used to format HTML and make it look good.

## About this course
### What will I learn?
    
In this course, you will build several websites to introduce you to basic and intermediate website development with HTML and CSS. This course won’t teach any Javascript – if you want an introduction to Javascript, head over to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) for some great resources.
    
You will learn what HTML is and how to properly structure an HTML document. You will learn how to do things like add images to a webpage, how to build web forms to collect information from users, and how to create links between webpages.
    
You will also learn how to properly create CSS files and link them to your HTML. You will learn to use CSS to create page layouts, manipulate page appearance, and even create animations to make your sites more interesting.

### What do I need to know?
    
Not much. This course starts at the very beginning of HTML development, so you don’t need to know anything about HTML or CSS to start. However, you will need to know how to use a computer. It’s important for you to understand [how to create new folders](https://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-create-a-new-folder-in-windows-10/) and [how to use a web browser](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internetbasics/using-a-web-browser/1/). Other than that, you will learn everything you need to know in the course.

### What software do I need to have?
    
Everything you absolutely need is already on your computer.
    
You need a text editor to write the code because websites are basically just collections of text files and images. If you like, you can use whatever text editor comes on your computer (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS), but this course uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) because it provides basic and advanced features useful for beginners and experienced programmers alike – and best of all, it’s completely free!.
    
You also need a web browser to view the web pages you write. Any web browser will work, but this course uses [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome). At this point it’s not that important which browser you use, but if you start developing in Javascript, Chrome has excellent Javascript tools that you’ll use pretty often. 

(When you start building websites to actually upload to the cloud for people to visit, it's important that you test your website in many different browsers because different browsers sometimes have differences that can cause your site to work in Firefox, for example, but not Chrome - or vice versa.)

### How long does it take?
    
That’s up to you. Some people learn HTML & CSS in just a few weeks, while others can take months or years to get proficient. It’s mainly a product of how much work you put into learning, but to a degree, it also has to do with your existing experience. If you’re not already good with computers, you will have to work a lot harder to become a programmer or web developer - just like you have to know math before trying to become a chemist, you should know computers before trying to become a web developer.
    
Now let’s get started learning to build websites!
