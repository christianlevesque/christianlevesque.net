## Questions

### 1:40-45 (Jesus cleanses the leper)

Again, why demand secrecy? See discussion on Matt. 8:2-4.

### 2:16-17

> ^16^And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?" ^17^And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."

Firstly, what is the gospel obsession with tax collectors? Is it just our natural aversion to paying taxes? They're always spoken of as if they are chief among the sinners.

Secondly, what does Jesus mean that he came not for the righteous, but the sinners? This seems contrary to the traditional gospel message, that all have fallen short and there are none righteous.

### 3:11-12

> ^11^And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God." ^12^And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.

Why keep the demons from making him known?

### 3:20-21

> ^20^Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. ^21^And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, "He is out of his mind."

...what? Is this saying that Jesus' family thought he was crazy?

### 3:28-29

> ^28^Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, ^29^but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin..."

Mark words this a little differently than Matthew did in 12:31-32. What is "eternal sin"? What does it mean to "never have forgiveness"? Is forgiveness denied to those who ask it? or is such a heart so far gone that it is no longer capable of seeking forgiveness?

This fits with eternal conscious torment and annihilationism just fine. How does it fit with universalism?

### 5:18-19

> ^18^As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. ^19^And he did not permit him but said to him, "Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."

Why the sudden change of heart? Across all of Matthew and the first 4 chapters of Mark, Jesus wants to be the best-kept secret. Now he tells a random possessed man that he should shout it from the rooftops?

### 5:43

> And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.

Never mind, we're back to secrecy.

### 6:5

> And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.

Was Jesus actually impeded by their lack of faith? or did he simply do no works because of their rejection of him?

### 6:14

> King Herod heard of it (Jesus' miracles), for Jesus' name had become known....

(See also Matt. 14) This must be a different Herod. Is there an historical record of multiple Herods ruling in the region?

### 6:19-20 vs. Matt 14:5

> ^19^And Herodias had a grudge against [John the Baptist] and wanted [Herod] to put him to death. But she could not, ^20^for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.

vs.

> And though [Herod] wanted to put [John the Baptist] to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.

6:19 says Herodias wanted to put John to death, and 6:20 says that Herod himself "heard him gladly". However, Matt. 14:5 says that Herod wanted John dead, and he only refrained because he feared the people. Which is true? There doesn't seem to be a reconciliation.

### 6:45-52 (Jesus walks on water)

Why is there no mention of Peter walking out on the water? This seems like an important part of the character arc of Peter, and yet there's no mention of it here.

### 7:18-19

> ^18^And he said to them, "Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, ^19^since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled? (Thus he declared all foods clean.)"

ESV says Jesus declared all foods clean by his words. KJV says "purging all meats", but the words are *καθαρίζω* (katharizo, G2511) *cleanse* or *purge*, and *βρῶμα* (broma, G1033), *food*.

On a side note, Peter's vision in Acts 10:9-28 has often been interpreted to mean the same thing. However, many people rightly point out that in that passage, God's point isn't that all foods are clean, but that all *people* are clean - i.e., Gentiles are no longer undesirables. The same people who point out that this passage refers to Gentiles and not meat sometimes argue that Old Testament law regarding food is still in effect. This verse seems to support the abolition of Old Testament food laws.

### 7:26 vs. Matt 15:22

> Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.

vs.

> And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon."

Is there a difference between *Canaanite* and *Syrophoenician*?

### 7:36

> And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.

More secrecy. Is Jesus using reverse psychology? What's going on?

### 8:12

> And [Jesus] sighed deeply in his spirit and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation."

Why no mention of the "sign of Jonah"? Is it not important?

### 8:22-26

> ^22^And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. ^23^And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, "Do you see anything?" ^24^And he looked up and said, "I see people, but they look like trees, walking." ^25^Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. ^26^And he sent him to his home, saying, "Do not even enter the village."

Firstly, why did Jesus have to heal the man twice?

Secondly, more secrecy.

### 8:30

> And [Jesus] strictly charged [the disciples] to tell no one about him.

More secrecy.

In context, Jesus is telling the disciples not to tell anyone he is the Christ. But isn't that the whole reason Jesus came? It almost seems like Jesus is telling the disciples to preach repentance, but without mentioning Jesus at all.

### 8:36

> For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?

See discussion on Matt. 16:26.

### 9:1

> And [Jesus] said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power."

See discussion on Matt. 16:28.

### 9:43-48

> ^43^And if your hand causes you to sin, cut if off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. ^44^(Omitted) ^45^And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. ^46^(Omitted) ^47^And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, ^48^"where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched."

See discussion on Matt. 18:8-9.

### 9:49

> For everyone will be salted with fire.

This statement immediately follows the previous quote. What does it mean that "everyone will be salted with fire"? Universalists believe that everyone will pass through the purifying flames of hell. This could also be a reference to "baptism by fire" - either you will be saved (and indwelt with the Holy Spirit, ergo baptized by fire) or else you will not, and you will go to hell.

### 10:17

> And as [Jesus] was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

See discussion on Matt. 19:16.

### 10:29-30

> ^29^Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, ^30^who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life."

See disucssion on Matt. 19:29.

### 16:16

> Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.

What is the role of baptism in salvation? Sometimes it is mentioned as a part of the salvific plan, and other times it is not. Is it secondary?

The word *condemned* here is *κατακρίνω* (katakrino, G2632). KJV translates it as *damned*. The Strong entry for this word suggests that the meaning is *to judge against* or *to sentence*. The idea of *damnation* seems like a heavy-handed translation, considering the word itself seems to have such a general connotation (apparently, no different than a small sentence for a petty crime).

### 16:18

> ...[my servants] will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.

Something tells me this is not accurate. Surely, there's an example somewhere of Christians being fatally poisoned or envenomated.
