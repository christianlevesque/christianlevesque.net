As part of my deconstruction, I'm going to do a full survey of the New Testament. This will involve a complete readthrough of the New Testament, cover to cover. I'm going to write down any verses that I have questions, comments, or concerns about, and then I'm going to address those verses one by one.

I have plenty of questions that need addressing. I intend to try to find biblical answers to each of those questions during my survey. One of my biggest focuses is going to be on the question of the eternal destination of souls, so I'm going to put extra focus on verses that meaningfully address eternity.

There are three major viewpoints in Christian thought:

- **Eternal conscious torment** This is the predominant view in Christianity today. Sinners who do not repent and trust in Jesus are sent, body and soul, into the lake of fire for eternity. Their torment is constant and unending. There are different forms of the eternal conscious torment belief, such as degrees of punishment (i.e., Hitler will be punished more severely than George from down the street who stopped going to church as a teenager, but both will be punished eternally).
- **Annihilationism** This is the view that the souls of sinners do not suffer consciously for eternity. Rather, annihilationists believe that the Second Death is truly death. There are different forms of annihilationism with varied beliefs, but they mainly agree on at least one thing: sinners will be punished for their sins, but at the end of their suffering, their souls are utterly destroyed and they cease to exist.
- **Universal reconciliation** This is the view that every person who ever existed will ultimately go to Heaven. There are different forms of universalism, but they all agree on this: sinners are loved by their Father in Heaven, and God will never give up until all of his children are saved from their sins.

## What I'm doing

I'm literally sitting down, reading the entire New Testament cover-to-cover, and taking notes by hand. Each time I have a question about the meaning of a verse, I will write that verse down, along with my question and any musings I might have at the time. Then later, I will go and do research to try to resolve my questions.

Here, I'm going to document the process book-by-book. Once I've completed my survey, I'm going to go through and address each question in turn. I'll be able to answer many questions at once (such as the meaning of certain Greek words, for example), so I'll wait until I'm completely finished to investigate the answers to my questions.

I don't plan to give any real pomp and circumstance to this section because this is primarily for my own use. I want people to see my process though. I'll draw conclusions in my main post series about my deconstruction, but for now, I'm just going to document the questions and post a blurb at the end of each book survey exploring my overall thoughts.

I'm using the English Standard Version for my reading. ESV is a word-for-word translation, so it's generally considered very accurate. I'm doing the study using the e-Sword app for iPad, so I'm also able to easily reference the KJV+, which has a built-in Strong's concordance. I'll make reference to Greek words several times during this survey; when I do, I'll include the Strong number for reference.
