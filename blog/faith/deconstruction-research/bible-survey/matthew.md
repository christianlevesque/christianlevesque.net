## Questions

### 2:22

> But when [Joseph] heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee.

Why does Joseph receive a revelation to return home (Matt. 2:19-20), only to receive a different revelation *after* he conveniently learns that the new ruler is just as bad as Herod?

### 3:10

> Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

Loosely supports the annihilationist view, with a few caveats.

1. This is clearly a metaphor, so it doesn't necessarily impart an exact spiritual truth.
2. "The fire" isn't exactly a specific statement of eternal destination. It simply invokes the idea of being consumed by flames.

### 3:12

>  His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

Doesn't really support any particular view. Seems to support the annihilationist view, but as with 3:10, the duration and purpose of the flame is ambiguous. "Unquenchable fire" is compatible with all three views:

- **eternal conscious torment** accepts an unquenchable fire as eternally punishing its victims
- **annihilationism** accepts an unquenchable fire as irreversibly consuming its victims
- **universalism** accepts an unquenchable fire as well-suited to destroying impurities in the souls of sinners

### 5:16 vs 6:1-4

> In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.

vs.

> ^1^Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. ^2^Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. ^3^But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, ^4^so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

How do you reconcile these verses? It almost seems like a contradiction, but it could just be a matter of intent. In 5:16, the intent is to glorify God. In 6:1-4, the intent is to glorify the self.

Moving on from 6:1-4, it seems like duality is the theme of Matt. 6. v1-18 address hypocrisy, while the rest of the chapter warns against earthly materialism at the expense of spirituality.

7:1-6 seems to return to this theme of hypocrisy. The famous "judge not" verse doesn't preclude judgment, but rather hypocrisy. E.g., verse 5 explicitly states that removing the speck from your brother's eye is OK, and even implies that this is a good goal. But applying verse 3 to verse 5 shows that hypocrisy is the real enemy, not judgment as such.

### 7:13-14

> ^13^Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. ^14^For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.

The word for "destruction" here is *ἀπώλεια* (apoleia, G684). According to Strong's dictionary, this word is associated with the idea of loss or ruin. Does this mean eternal damnation? Are there non-biblical sources from around 2,000 years ago that agree *ἀπώλεια* means destruction?

Even if it does mean destruction in the assumed sense, the nature of the destruction is not specified. Is it total and utter destruction of the soul? or is it destruction of the self? or destruction of character? Verse 13 could be interpreted in an annihilationist sense or a universalist sense, depending on the connotation. It seems the clearest reading of this verse is annihilationist, especially when considered alongside verse 14 (few find life). There is no mention of hell at all, so unless we take ἀπώλεια to be a euphemism for hell, this passage is not supportive of eternal conscious torment.

### 7:19

> Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

Like 3:10 and 3:12, 7:19 is mildly annihilationist. The subtext is that a tree thrown into a fire is consumed utterly, but as this is a metaphor, I don't know how literally we're supposed to take this verse.

### 7:21-23

> ^21^Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. ^22^On that day many will say to me, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?" ^23^ And then I will declare to them, "I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness."

How does one who does "mighty works" in Jesus' name *not* enter the Kingdom? Is this about false teachers? or perhaps those who do works in vain to be praised by men (see 6:1-4 above)?

### 8:2-4

> ^2^And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean." ^3^And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleaned. ^4^And Jesus said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them."

Why does Jesus command the leper to keep his healing secret?

### 9:8

> When the growds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.

If Jesus is God the Son, did God "give such authority to men"? This verse makes little sense at face value if Jesus is God in the flesh.

### 9:30-31 (same as 8:2-4)

> ^30^And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about it." ^31^But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.

Why make them keep their healing a secret? Especially when he had to know they would tell everyone, because everyone knew they were blind. What are they supposed to do, pretend to still be blind?

### 10:28

> And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.

This seems pretty firmly annihilationist, but I have my doubts because of the language used. It ultimately depends on the specific meaning of the word "destroy", which is the Greek *ἀπόλλυμι* (apollumi, G622). I find it interesting that a different word is used here than the word "kill", which is *ἀποκτείνω* (apokteino, G615). *ἀποκτείνω* means "kill", but God doesn't kill the soul *ἀποκτείνω*, instead he destroys the soul *ἀπόλλυμι*. What is the significance of this difference? It's not that the word "soul" doesn't make sense in the context of killing, because Jesus himself just spoke of a soul being killed (namely, that man can't do it) - so it would make sense for Jesus to speak of God killing a soul, especially as a parallel to his prior statement that man *can't* kill a soul. But instead, Jesus used the word *ἀπόλλυμι*, and I suspect there is significance in that.

### 11:2-3

> ^2^Now, when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples. ^3^and said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"

Why doesn't John know Jesus is the Messiah? They're literally cousins, and Jesus even met John to be baptized in Chapter 3. He seemed to know who Jesus was at the time. Is this a moment of despair, as I learned growing up Baptist? Make it make sense!

### 11:12

> From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force.

How does heaven "suffer violence"? How is heaven "taken by force"? Who is doing this? Jesus simply calls them "the violent".

### 12:15-16

> ^15^Jesus, aware of [the Pharisees' conspiracy to destroy him], withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all ^16^and ordered them not to make him known.

Once more, why the orders of silence? Verses 17-21 quote Isaiah, but nothing in the Isaiah passage quoted explains Jesus' demand for anonymity.

### 13 (full chapter)

Jesus alludes to the end of the age in several parables. But none of these parables speak to eternal hell. Verse 30 seems annihilationist at face value, but again, this is a parable and not necessarily meant to be an accurate description of reality. Verses 42 and 50 speak to a state of torment (literally a furnace) for the wicked, but the duration and terms of torment are not specified.

### 15:22-28

> ^22^And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon." ^23^But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us." ^24^He answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." ^25^But she came and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, help me." ^26^And he answered, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs." ^27^She said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table." ^28^Then Jesus answered her, "O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire." And her daughter was healed instantly.

People who have deconstructed sometimes come away with a harsh and critical view of the Bible, even if they don't leave the faith. I've seen several people claim Jesus is calling the woman a dog, and I even saw one man on Twitter claim that Jesus called the woman a bitch. Obviously, this is not what Jesus did. As for the first claim, Jesus used a metaphor that the woman may have found offensive, but that doesn't mean Jesus is calling her a dog. I won't dignify the second charge with a response, because it's utterly ludicrous.

More to the point, though, why won't Jesus heal her daughter to begin with? and why does he change his mind? Was this some sort of test of her faith? Jesus didn't hesitate to heal the centurion's servant in Matt. 8:5-13, so why would he hesitate to heal the woman's daughter now?

### 16:1-4

> ^1^And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. ^4^"....An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah."...

What is this "sign of Jonah"?

### 16:20

> Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.

Why keep his identity as Christ a secret?

### 16:26

> For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?

The meaning here depends on the connotation of *ζημιόω* (zemioo, G2210). Translated as "forfeit" in ESV and "lose" in KJV, Strong defines the word as "be cast away, receive damage, lose, suffer loss". Two of these possible meanings are universalist ("receive damage" and "suffer loss" both imply the survival of the whole), while "cast away" and "lose" are neutral in that both can be true of someone whose soul is destroyed, whose soul is temporarily imprisoned, or whose soul is permanently relegated to torment.

### 16:28

> Truly, I saw to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.

All of these people are dead. What does "coming in his kingdom" mean? Is this an allusion to the ascension on the Mount of Olives?

### 18:8-9

> ^8^And if your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet be thrown into eternal fire. ^9^And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes be thrown into the hell of fire.

In verse 8, Jesus says "eternal fire". This word "eternal" is the Greek word *αἰώνιος* (aionios, G166). According to the universalist perspective, this word is almost never translated as "eternal" outside of the Bible. Rather, it implies a duration of time that can be inferred from context. Greek has a word for "eternal", so why allude to eternity when you could just say it?

In verse 9, the word "hell" is used, but the word in Greek is *γέεννα* (gehenna, G1067). Both annihilationists and universalists point out that this word is a reference to Gehenna, also known as the Valley of Hinnom, which is a geographical location used as a rubbish heap. The implication here is that Jesus isn't speaking about "hell" because no such word appears in the Bible. Rather, Jesus is alluding either literally or figuratively to a real, geographical place of ruin.

### 18:19

> Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.

What's the catch? There are any number of examples of when this isn't the case.

### 18:21-35 (Parable of the Unforgiving Servant)

Here, Jesus paints a picture of a person crushed beneath the weight of an enormous debt. The master forgives the debt in his mercy, but the servant extracts payment from a fellow servant over a much smaller debt. When the master learns of this, he sends the servant to jail until the entire debt is paid. Most notably, Jesus promises the same treatment for his followers who do not forgive others.

Is this universalist? Jesus' sory implies that the debt can be paid and the servant released. 10,000 talents is an enormous debt, but nothing in the parable suggests the amount is insurmountable. Perhaps the usage of such a large debt is meant to figuratively illustrate an insurmountable one? I find this unlikely, mainly because unlike most parables, Jesus explicitly draws a direct comparison to a spiritual truth - that God will do the same to believers who don't forgive others. If the debt were literally insurmountable, wouldn't Jesus have said so? The parable seems firmly universalist, and it has the added bonus of Jesus' promise that God will do the same as the master in the parable. The master in the parable sent the servant away until the debt was paid, and that seems to be the behavior that Jesus promises on his followers, implying that our debts, too, can be paid.

### 19:7-8

> ^7^They said to him, "Why then did Moses command [a man] to give a certificate of divorce and send [his wife] away?" ^8^He said to them, "Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so."

Was the law written by Moses, or by God? Jesus seems to imply here that Moses wrote the law, and that Moses allowed divorce against God's intention.

Did God only write the 10 commandments? What implications does this have for the rest of the law, such as verses prohibiting homosexuality?

### 19:16

> And behold, a man came up to him, saying, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"

This verse is interesting because of its use of *αἰώνιος* (aionios, G166). Some literature claims that *αἰώνιος* refers to a finite period of time, but here it is translated as "eternal" in regards to life, not just punishment. This implies one of two things: either *αἰώνιος* can legitimately mean "eternal", or else the "life" spoken of here is not eternal. The first is not good for the universalist perspective, and the second is not good for Christianity as a whole. Which is it?

### 19:23-24

> ^23^And Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. ^24^Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."

Can a rich man go to heaven or not? Is this hyperbole in the difficulty aspect, or hyperbole in the possibility aspect?

In other words, is Jesus saying a rich man can go to heaven, and using a seemingly impossible example to describe how hard it is? Or is Jesus being facetious and using a literally impossible example to describe something impossible, but saying it's really hard as a form of understatement?

This is followed immediately by the famous "With God, all things are possible" verse in 19:26, so it certainly seems like the rich can be saved. But it's obvious Jesus doesn't think too highly of them.

### 19:29

> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.

This is another use of *αἰώνιος* (aionios, G166) that juxtaposes with the concept of "life" and not simply "punishment". If this word really means "finite period of time", why is it used here to refer to what Christians call "eternal life"? Is life in heaven not eternal? or is punishment really eternal, despite the best efforts of universalists to claim otherwise?

### 20:1-16 (Parable of the vineyard workers)

Paul teaches that works are rewarded in heaven, so I don't think this parable alludes to eternal life as the wages of the metaphoric labor. Maybe I'm reading too much into this. But it almost seems like a universalist story. Many Christians today almost seem to revel in the thought that their "enemies" are going to hell. If universalism is true, these Christians are probably going to be upset that the "undeserving" will eventually get the same reward as them.

### 20:28

> ...even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.

This word "many" is *πολύς* (polus, G4183). There are comparative and superlative forms of the word, just like in English (essentially, "more" and "most"). Jesus doesn't claim he gave his life as a ransom for *all*, only *many*. Is this significant?

### 21:22

> And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.

Again, there are countless examples of this *not* being true. Why is this unqualified?

### 22:12-13

> ^12^And he said to him, "Friend, how did you get in here (the wedding feast) without a wedding garment?" ^13^Then the king said to the attendants, "Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

What does it mean to enter the wedding feast without a garment? What does this allude to?

### 22:30

> For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.

Is there sex in heaven? Jesus says we will be "like angels", and evangelicals have taken this to mean that we will be celibate. But I'm not sure that that's true, based on what we know of God and sin.

Is there anything sinful that God created as-is? I think not. Every sin that exists is a bastardization of something good.

Sex? Good. Premarital sex? Sin.

Food? Good. Gluttony? Sin.

We could go on all day, but I can't think of anything God created that is inherently sinful. Even more abstract sins like lying are born out of a good part of our nature, such as our drive for self-preservation or the desire not to cause pain to others.

I say this because the nephilim exist (assuming you take the Bible literally). In order for nephilim to exist, angels must have working genitalia and functional sex cell production. Why would God create angels with fully functional sexual systems if he didn't intend for them to use them? The only function of angelic sexual organs would be sinful in that case, and no other system has been created that is inherently sinful. Therefore, I propose that there may in fact be sex in heaven, without the need for a marriage contract. Jesus' rebuke that there is no marriage in heaven is then allowed to stand on its own without interfering with other parts of the biblical narrative.

(If there is no marriage, how can sex not be sinful? I believe Paul has the answer to this question. Paul taught that without the law, sin is dead. And in the Kingdom, the law will be completed. If the law is completed, and without the law there is no sin, is it possible that in heaven, there is no sin because the concept of sin is obsolete? I may be wrong, and I'm certainly not concerned about whether this is true or not. Just some food for thought.)

### 23:8-10

> ^8^But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. ^9^And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. ^10^Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ.

How much of this is literal? I can't help but see parallels between this passage and the modern churches. We call our church leaders "pastor", "father", "elder", etc. Will Jesus condemn this?

### 23:23

> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.

What does Jesus mean by "justice", *κρίσις* (krisis, G2920)? KJV translates *κρίσις* as "judgment", while ESV translates it as "justice". Strong suggests the word is associated with a tribunal, so "judgment" is probably the intended connotation. But mercy and faithfulness are juxtaposed here. Is there an implied hierarchy, or are they intended to be equal?

### 23:33

> You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?

Here, ESV says "sentenced to hell", while KJV says "damnation of hell". The Greek here is *κρίσις* (krisis, G2920) and *γέεννα* (gehenna, G1067). *κρίσις* is the same word from 23:23 for "judgment", while *γέεννα* is the same word that is often translated as hell, but refers to the Valley of Hinnom.

Nothing in the connotation implies eternal duration. Nothing about a formal sentencing requires that sentence to be eternal. "Damnation" seems to be an opinionated and heavy-handed translation that KJV translators read into the text based on their theological beliefs, rather than the other way around.

### 24:34

> Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.

Evangelicals believe Matthew 24 is prophetic of the end times. I often heard growing up that 24:32 is prophetic of the recreation of Israel in 1948, and that 24:34 means that Jesus' return will take place before the last people who saw Israel reformed in 1948 pass away.

Is this meant to be prophetic for the modern day? Or is this meant literally for that time? If this is meant literally for the first century CE, what happened at the time that fulfilled Jesus' words?

### 24:50-51

> ^50^...the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know ^51^and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Firstly, as always, this is a parable. But it is also indeterminate. The wicked servant here is cut in pieces, but then sent to a place that seems to be populated by living people to be punished. This doesn't seem annihilationist, but it doesn't explicitly fit eternal conscious torment either.

### 25:1-13 (Parable of the Ten Virgins)

All this discusses is a wedding feast. The wedding feast is believed to be a real event in Christian eschatology, so it's possible this is an allusion to that event, but even taken as a parable for heaven, this doesn't seem like a strong case for any viewpoint. There isn't even any weeping or gnashing of teeth - all that happened here is that the foolish virgins were locked out of the feast.

### 25:14-30 (Parable of the Talents)

What is the "outer darkness"? There is no eternal hell or punishment here, just weeping and gnashing of teeth.

### 25:41

> Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."

The word here is not literally "eternal", but rather *αἰώνιος* (aionios, G166). We saw this in 18:8-9, and as we discussed then, the word *αἰώνιος* implies a finite duration of time, to be inferred from context.

### 25:46

> And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.

Here we see "eternal punishment" and "eternal life". At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the word "eternal" is *αἰώνιος* (aionios, G166), which can sometimes mean eternal but only when the context requires it. Typically it means a finite duration of time.

The word for "punishment" is *κόλασις* (kolasis, G2851). This word usage is notable because universalists claim that the Greek word does not have the connotation of "retribution" per se. Rather, they claim, the word denotes a punishment intended to correct. The usage of *κόλασις*, then, is akin to putting a child in time-out - not meant to exact vengeance upon the child for poor behavior, but rather meant to ensure the poor behavior doesn't continue.

These words together, if the universalist interpretation is correct, paint a *much* different picture of hell than the doctrine of eternal conscious torment. Rather than a place where a Jonathan Edwards-style God extracts vicious punishment from the unrepentant for all eternity, hell becomes a place where a loving Father corrects and purifies his children in preparation for their eventual admission into heaven.

How do we interpret this verse then? The wicked go into "aionios" punishment, but the righteous go into "aionios" life - in other words, it seems that the duration of both the punishment and the life is limited by context. There are three interpretations that I think make sense:

1. The wicked enter a period of punishment, and the righteous enter a period of life. Because these statements are parallel in the verse, it follows that their meanings are also parallel. Because we know the reward for the righteous is eternal life, we can infer the duration of "aionios": eternity. Thus, even though "aionios" usually means a finite duration, in this case, it prescribes eternal life for the righteous and eternal punishment for the wicked.
2. Alternatively, we could modify the logic of #1 slightly. In context, if "kolasis" is corrective in nature, how can it be eternal? This would be like sending a child to time-out forever in hopes that they will stop misbehaving - it simply makes no sense to have an eternal corrective punishment. So from other contexts in the Bible, we can see that the reward of the righteous is eternal life, but because the word for "punishment" is "kolasis", it doesn't make sense for the parallel punishment to also be eternal.
3. Or, we could take the statement at its literal face value. The wicked enter a "limited period of punishment", while the righteous enter a "limited period of life". There are a couple different interpretations of this statement: either life is not eternal for the righteous, or eternal life begins after "aionios" is over - after the wicked are corrected ("kolasis") and the righteous have their temporary reward, all will enter a later period of eternal life in the kingdom.

### 26:24

> The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.

This verse raises a lot of questions for me, because I don't think it makes sense in any context (universalism, annihilationism, or eternal conscious torment).

If universalism is true, how could it have been better for Judas to never have been born? Under a universalist perspective, Judas will be punished for his sins and eventually enter into eternal life, and despite the severity of punishment he must have endured by that time, his life will forevermore be heavenly.

Under an annihilationist perspective, Judas will someday cease to exist, and any temporal punishment he endures will be erased from conscious existence - no different than if he had never been born.

Under eternal conscious torment, this statement hardly bears mentioning because the vast majority of people will end up in hell for eternity. Not only would it be better for Judas that *he* hadn't been born, it would be better for *almost everyone* that they hadn't been born.

Most perplexingly, this statement by Jesus certainly seems to be special. What exactly is it that Jesus is trying to say? I don't think Jesus is saying something that carries any signifigance for anyone except Judas.

### 26:28

> ...for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

Jesus' blood was shed for "many", *πολύς* (polus, G4183). However, previously Jesus said there are "few" who find eternal life. Does this imply a universalist message? Or is "few" meant comparatively, while "many" shows that there are still countless millions who are saved even though this is a small portion of humanity?

### 27:44

> And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.

Why is there no mention of the thief who converted? It's entirely possible that the thief initially "reviled" Jesus, while later recognizing Jesus' divinity and converting.
