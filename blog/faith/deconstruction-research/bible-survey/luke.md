## Questions

### Chapter 2

Why is there no mention of Jesus going to Egypt? Compare the stories in Matthew and Luke to see how they align and where they conflict.

### 3:19-20

> ^19^But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by [John] for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done, ^20^added this to them all, that he locked up John in prison.

See discussion on Luke 6:19-20 vs. Matt 14:5. This passage seems to support the Matthew interpretation of events and contract the Mark interpretation.

### 3:23-38 (Geneaology of Jesus)

This geneaology differs in a number of ways from the genealogy in Matthew. The number of generations is different, and many of the names are different or out of order. For example, Luke writes that Jesus is descended from David through Nathan (Luke 3:31), while Matthew says it is through Solomon (Matthew 1:6-7). I've heard various explanations for why these geneaologies are different.

Once explanation I've heard goes something like this: There are different concepts of geneaologies in Jewish tradition and Gentile tradition. Because Matthew was writing to a Jewish audience, he used the traditional Jewish geneaology, possibly recorded by the temple or other official source, which sometimes skips generations or attributes a child to a different descendent for various reasons that are completely valid within the Jewish tradition. However, because Luke was writing to a Gentile audience, he used a verbatim geneaology.

Another explanation that I've heard is that the Matthew geneaology is of Joseph, and the Luke geneaology is of Mary. This explanation is bolstered by the notion that the Jewish tradition would expect Jesus to be paternally descended from David, even considering his virgin birth. Gentiles, however, would be more concerned about whether Jesus was actually bodily related to David, and since Jesus had no human father, his mother would have to be a descendant of David. This is supported by the fact that the father of Joseph in both geneaologies is different. In Luke, Joseph is the son of Heli, then Matthat, then Levi, then Melchi, then Jannai, then Joseph. In Matthew, Joseph is the son of Jacob, then Matthan, then Eleazar, then Eliud, then Achim, then Zadok. Futher generations could be fabricated, but we would expect at least the first couple generations to match - at the very least, Luke and Matthew should both know the name of Jesus' grandfather.

Are either of these explanations viable? or is there a third explanation that makes more sense? or is this a fabrication?

### 5:14

> And he charged him to tell no one, but "Go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, for a proof to them."

More secrecy.

### 9:25

> For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?

This is a slightly different wording from the passages in Matthew 16:26 and Mark 8:36. Matthew and Mark both use *ζημιόω* (zemioo, G2210), translated as *lose* but literally meaning *be cast away*, *receive damage*, *lose*, or *suffer loss*.

However, Luke uses two different phrases here. "...forfeits himself" is translated from *ζημιόω* as well, and in KJV it is translated as *be cast away*. However, "loses" is the much stronger word *ἀπόλλυμι* (apollumi, G622), meaning *destroy*, *die*, or *lose*. (This word is very similar to *Ἀπολλύων* [Apollyon, G623], which is the Greek name of Abaddon the Destroyer, angel of the bottomless pit.)

### 9:59-62

> ^59^To another [Jesus] said, "Follow me." But he said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father." ^60^And Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God." ^61^Yet another said, "I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell to those at my home." ^62^Jesus said to him, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."

What is the meaning of Jesus' rebukes here? What does "Leave the dead to bury their own dead" actually mean? Is Jesus really saying that saying farewell to your family is enough to keep you from the kingdom?

## Comments

### 1:33

> ...and [Jesus] will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.

This is the first time we see the concept of eternity in the New Testament that is not the word *αἰώνιος* (aionios, G166). There is contention that *αἰώνιος* means a finite duration inferred from context, so if this is true, then usage of *αἰώνιος* needs a good reason to mean *eternal*. This word *forever* is actually two Greek words: *εἰς* (eis, G1519), meaning *into*, *for*, *unto*, or *toward;* and *αἰών* (aion, G165), which literally means *an age*. (*αἰών aion* seems to be the root of *αἰώνιος aionios*.) This phrase translated as *forever* has a literal meaning of *unto the age*. This is a phrase we see a lot in the New Testament, so how do we know it is meant to mean "forever"?

Well, the second clause of this sentence is a good indicator. "...of his kingdom there will be no end" is less ambiguous. The phrase *no end* is two Greek words: *οὐ* (ou, G3756), meaning *no* or *not;* and *τέλος* (telos, G5056), meaning *limit*, *conclusion*, or *result*. This certainly seems to be the correct translation of the phrase.

### 3:12-13

> ^12^Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?" ^13^And he said to them, "Collect no more than you are authorized to do."

Does this answer my previous question about why tax collectors are a recurring scapegoat in the gospels? It seems that tax collectors might have been overcharging and skimming off the top.

### 7:3-5

> ^3^When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant. ^4^And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy to have you do this for him, ^5^for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue."

This is probably the explanation for why Jesus healed the centurion's servant when he wouldn't initially heal the Canaanite woman's daughter - the centurion had done many good works for his local Jewish brothers.
