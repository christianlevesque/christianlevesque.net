Well, I've deconstructed. I'm done.

I had every intention of keeping an ongoing journal of my deconstruction. Obviously, that never happened. A lot has changed in the last year, so let's get right into it.

## What do I still believe about God?

In my previous article, I wrote a section about what I currently believe about God. I want to start by making a few updates to those beliefs, because while I believed at the time that those 3 core beliefs would not change, I was mistaken.

### ~~I believe the Bible is the Word of God.~~ I believe the Bible is an imperfect collection of man's musings on God.

My original statement was more about whether I still believed in the God of the Bible. I still do. I just don't believe the Bible is his word anymore. This ties closely into the next point, so I'll just explain more there.

### ~~I believe the Bible is divinely inspired and originally infallible.~~ I believe the Bible is God-breathed, man-authored.

This doesn't mean I don't believe the Bible. In fact, in a perverse way, I can now embrace the Bible more fully than I could before. When I believed the Bible was the infallible Word of God, I had to tread carefully in order to preserve that belief. If the Bible contradicted itself (and it obviously does), I had to find a way to resolve that contradiction. There were contradictions that I had a hard time addressing without mental gymnastics, and that hurt my faith. But fortunately, most of Christendom for all its history has believed that the Bible is a book written by man about God, and has treated its words accordingly. Don't fear for my soul - I'm in good company.

The most common response to the rejection of the Bible as God's word is 2 Timothy 3:16, which states: "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness...". The English phrase *God-breathed* is the Greek word *θεόπνευστος* (theopneustos). The ancient church didn't think this meant God dictated the body of scripture. The word *θεόπνευστος* was understood as "life-giving" - rather than God "breathing out" the words of scripture, scripture is "life-giving" in the same way that God breathed life into Adam.

Perhaps most importantly, the concept of the Bible as the Word of God is...unbiblical. The phrase "Word of God" appears many times in the Bible. Fortunately, the Bible itself identifies what the "Word of God" is: *Jesus!* In the Gospel of John, we read: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us..." (John 1:1,14). The evangelical insistence that the Bible is the Word of God (and especially the rejection of all translations but the KJV and its derivatives) is actually a form of idolatry. The Bible itself never claims to be God's spoken words, and the authors of scripture certainly never seem to think they are writing down God's spoken words. That's a modern doctrine, and I would argue that the belief that the Bible is God's literal Word is far more dangerous than the belief that it isn't.

For more information on approaching the Bible as a man-authored document, see [The Bible is Dead; Long Live the Bible](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-bible-is-dead-long-live-the-bible/) in *The Chronicle of Higher Education* and [Jesus, Not the Bible, Is the 'Word of God'](https://baptistnews.com/article/jesus-not-the-bible-is-the-word-of-god/) in *Baptist News Global*.

### I believe the Bible is meant to be a source of spiritual truth and wisdom, not a historical document or science book.

This is still my belief. However, it comes tempered with the knowledge that the Bible isn't even God's Word. Because the Bible was written by man, it's entirely reasonable to assume it makes mistakes. Ancients didn't know anything about cosmology or biology, so why should their stories include them? The Bible is at least as much a book about humans discovering God as it is a book about God revealing himself to humans.

It seems my beliefs on the last three points haven't evolved as much as I originally thought. Internally, it's felt like an enormous shift in perspective, but in reality, my stance hasn't shifted much. I've essentially gone from "The Bible is God-inspired, not God-authored" to "God didn't inspire the Bible, but it's still God-breathed" (in the *θεόπνευστος* sense). It feels massively different inside, but really, it's just a different shade of gray.

## Results of my specific points of deconstruction

In my previous article, I wrote another section where I listed what questions I had to address during my deconstruction. I've answered all of these questions to my own satisfaction. I'll address each answer in its own article.
