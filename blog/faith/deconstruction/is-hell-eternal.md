Hell.

Liberal Christians, atheists, and those who belong to other faiths are rolling their eyes. They refuse to believe that a good God - a *righteous* God, a *holy* God - could willingly consign any of his children to an eternity of unqualified, unmitigated torture. And this is a thought that I've flirted with for a long time.

When I was a teenager, I considered what it would mean to burn in hell forever. I sat down for a few minutes and actually imagined the process of burning in a lake of fire, hotter than the insides of a star, trapped in a perfect, immortal body whose only flaw was the presence of pain receptors. In my mind's eye, I found that I was unable to move or see anything. I imagined that the lake of fire was pristinely dark despite the flames, and that the only company in the darkness was the smell of my own burning flesh and the cries of billions of other lost souls caught up in the same inescapable torture as myself.

As I said in my original post, the evangelical church uses (actively and passively) the threat of eternal hellfire to control its members. I feared for my salvation if I believed the wrong thing. Does the Bible teach the election of the saints? Either choice risked damnation because only one could be correct, and bad doctrine was possibly heretical. Some of you may think I'm being dramatic, or perhaps misinterpreting the teachings I grew up with. This is possible, but I'm far from the only person to grow up in evangelicalism who thinks this way. Although it is anecdotal, social media is replete with those who also feared God's wrath for questioning details of their faith.

Thomas Talbott makes the case that the Western church uses hell to excuse (and even encourage) religious abuse:

> "...religious persecution in the Western church typically has had its roots in an obsessive fear of eternal damnation. It is no doubt possible to believe in eternal damnation without believing that God would be so unjust as to damn someone eternally for an honest mistake in abstract theology. But fear is often irrational, and, as a matter of historical fact, the organized Christian church has consistently employed the fear of eternal damnation as a weapon against supposed theological error....It has consistently cultivated in its constituency the fear that those who die in unbelief, or with certain mistaken beliefs, are precisely those whom God will damn eternally in hell....Having no confidence in the love of God, those in the grips of such fear have too often wielded the sword in a sincere effort to protect their loved ones from the tragic consequences, as they have seen it, of error in religious matters." -Talbott, *The Inescapable Love of God*, p.26
