It’s a long-running tradition to write the “Hello World!” script for your first piece of code in any new language. We’ll be doing that here in just a minute.

But first, we need to set up a file to hold our code. If you haven’t already, start up VS Code and open the course folder you set up in the last lesson (if you haven’t opened any other folders in VS Code, it should open the course folder automatically when you launch the program). Right-click on the Introduction folder and create a new file. Name this file hello-world.html.
