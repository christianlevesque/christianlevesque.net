# Works I used

This site was built with several third-party tools, some of which were built by individual developers. Each of this site's top-level dependencies is listed here.

## Widgets and themes

Most of the visuals on this site are drab - that's by design! But some of the work actually looks pretty good, and most of it isn't mine.

- Syntax highlighting is provided by [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com).
- The syntax highlighting theme used on my website is [Prism Material Dark](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/blob/master/themes/prism-material-dark.css), which was developed by [dutchenkoOleg](https://github.com/dutchenkoOleg).

## Build

No one writes unbundled Javascript anymore, do they? This site was built with a few powerful tools that made my life easier.

- This site was built on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev).
- Markdown compilation was done with [Markdown-It](https://markdown-it.github.io/markdown-it/)
- Bundling was done with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).
- JS transpilation was done with [Babel](https://babeljs.io).
- Sass transpilation was done with [Dart-Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass)

## Infrastructure

The work these libraries do may not be as sexy as Webpack or Babel, but without them, we would have nothing.
